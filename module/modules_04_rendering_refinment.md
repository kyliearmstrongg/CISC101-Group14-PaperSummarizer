# Module 04: Rendering & Refinement

## Logic & Steps
1. **Combined Summary Generation**
    - Synthesize all section summaries into a single, coherent summary (100–300 words).
    - Remove any redundant points; emphasize central findings and clear narrative flow.

2. **Formatting Consistency**
    - Assemble outputs following Markdown and section order.
    - Ensure summary level, tone, and terminology are consistently applied.

3. **Glossary Compilation**
    - Extract and define key terms/abbreviations for clarity based on paper context.

## Output
- Final Paper Summary
- Complete Collection of Section Summaries
- Overall Combined Summary (100–300 words)
- Key Terms Glossary
