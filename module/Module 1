# Module 01: Intake & Setup

## Logic & Steps
1. **User Input Verification**
    - Check for provided section list, summary level, and length preference.
    - Confirm all paper sections are present and clearly labeled.

2. **Section Detection**
    - Parse the academic paper and identify all labeled sections.
    - Detect missing or empty sections; flag those under 50 words.

3. **Preparation**
    - Store user-selected summary level and length settings for all downstream processing.
    - Ready parsed content for modular summarization.

## Output
- Proceed to Section Loop only after all validation checks pass.
- If deficiencies are detected, warn user and await corrections.
