# Module 02: Section Loop

## Logic & Steps
1. **Original Order Enforcement**
    - Process each section as per original paper order.

2. **Summary Generation**
    - Generate summary for each section, ≤150 words.
    - Apply selected summary level tone and terminology.

3. **Technical Consistency**
    - Preserve all technical abbreviations and key terms as in source.
    - Avoid paraphrasing that oversimplifies or omits core ideas.

4. **Loop Structure**
    - Iterate through all sections, invoking guardrails after each summary.

## Output
- For each section: Markdown-formatted summary with section heading.
- All summaries collected in original order.
